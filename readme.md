# Graphs

JS GUI for exploring graph algorithms

![Screenshot om the UI][screenshot]

## Status

I just started this project. You can already construct a simple graph not not much else can be done yet.

## Future

I would like to implement:

* depth first search
* breath first search
* djikstra
* bellman-ford
* johnson's algorithm
* topological sort
* detect dag
* detect strongly connected components
* detect bi-partitions
* detect bi-connected components
* finite state automata simulation
* petri net simulation

## Usage

Run

```sh
$ yarn parcel index.html
```

Then open http://localhost:1234
